/**
 * A default implementation of the {@link LicenseProvider} that assumes the binary data from the signed and serialized
 * license is stored in a file. Various properties of this provider allow configuration of file prefixes (such as
 * a directory), file suffixes (such as an extension), whether or not the file can be found on the classpath, and
 * whether or not the contents of the file are Base64 encoded.<br />
 * <br />
 * This implementation also assumes that license contexts (lookup keys) are always either strings or have a meaningful
 * {@link Object#toString()} implementation that can be used within the file name.
