# This file contains Lucid's default rules, as specified in the default solrconfig.xml
# The default configuration uses this rules file in three places:
#   1. The Landing Page component, which can be used to short circuit results and just return a landing page
#   2. The RulesComponent configured to run before all other SearchComponents (there is also
#       one configured to run after all other components, except debug.
#   3. The RulesDocTransformer, which can be used to alter the fields on a document before it
#       is written out.
#
# Rule writers may rely on, when using the RulesComponent, the LandingPageComponent or the RulesDocTransformerFactory, the fact that
# the name of the "handler" (specified in the configuration) will be available as part of the Request context (request.getContext().get("rulesHandler")) along
# with the phase the component is in (prepare or process -- getContext().get("rulesPhase")) such that rules can be written that target a specific
# handler and/or a specific phase.
